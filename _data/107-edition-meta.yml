faq:
  - question: What is the distinction between the edition_meta and edition table?
    answer: >
      The edition_meta table establishes participants in the making of the edition, and quantifies the number of copies in the edition. It also indicates if the edition has been completed. The edition table records the specific pieces/copies in the edition.
  - question: What is the distinction between the different types of proofs?
    answer: >
      See edition_type enum
  - question: What is the distinction between the publisher and the manufacturer?

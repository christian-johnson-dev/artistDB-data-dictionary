faq:
  - question: What is the difference between a medium and a support?
    answer: >
      A medium is manipulated upon a support.  For example, oil paint is a medium that is applied to a canvas support. A support is what the art object is built from and the medium is what is applied to the support. In the case of a sculpture, the support is what the sculpture is cast or carved from. A plaster cast sculpture with paint applied to it would have a plaster support and a paint medium.
  
  - question: How are multiple supports related to an artwork?
    answer: >
      An artwork can have multiple supports. For example, a painting on paper may be mounted on panel. In this case, the artwork would be linked to both the paper and canvas supports through the <a href="#"><code>artwork_support</code></a> join table.

faq:
  - question: Why not simply put a value field in artwork and edition tables?
    answer: >
      Because the value of an artwork or edition changes over time, and we want to track that change.  For example, an artwork may be appraised at $100,000 in 2010, but appraised at $150,000 in 2015.  The `valuations` table allows us to track the change in value over time.  It also allows us to track the appraiser, the date of the appraisal, and any notes about the appraisal.  This information is not available if we simply put a value field in the artwork and edition tables.
